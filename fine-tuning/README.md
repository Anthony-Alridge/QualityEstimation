# Fine-tuning Pretrained Models

This directory contains the code used for fine-tuning pre-trained models, separated by pre-trained model.

The pre-trained models themselves are omitted due to their large file sizes.

Note that these were originally Colab notebooks.

model_testing was used to load fine-tuned models and generate predictions.txt.
